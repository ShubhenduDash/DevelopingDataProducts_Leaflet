# Introduction
This project was created as part of the Developing Data Products course of the Coursera Data Science Specialization. The goal of the project is to create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet, and to host the resulting web page on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

# Summary
This webpage was created in markdown using leaflet for mapping. It was created under the following guidelines:

- Create a webpage using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.
- Host the webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.
- The webpage must contain the date it was created, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet.

# The Map
Loading the required packages.

```{r}
#install.packages("leaflet") - commented this out in order to publish to HTML correctly. If running as a chunk of a code, leave this line in. 
library(leaflet)
```

Then we create the map showing India's top 5 polluted cities 2019 (PM2.5) 
The most polluted cities according to data aggregated from over 60,000 data points.[Check here for the Data.](https://www.iqair.com/us/world-most-polluted-cities?continent=59af92b13e70001c1bd78e53&country=SPLi4goKT3JDgP4Mm&state=&page=1&perPage=50&cities=)

```{r}
leaflet() %>%
addTiles() %>%
addMarkers(lat = 28.669081, lng = 77.430412, popup = "1-Ghaziabad, India") %>%
addMarkers(lat = 28.704060, lng = 77.102493, popup = "2-Delhi, India") %>%
addMarkers(lat = 28.535517, lng = 77.391029, popup = "3-Noida, India") %>%
addMarkers(lat = 28.459497, lng = 77.026634, popup = "4-Gurugram, India") %>%
addMarkers(lat =28.447720, lng = 77.524567, popup = "5-Greater Noida, India")
